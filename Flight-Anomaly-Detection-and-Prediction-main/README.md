# Predictive Maintenance for Aerospace Systems: Anomaly Detection and Prediction

## Executive Summary

This repository contains a simplified Python program for predictive maintenance in aerospace systems, focusing on anomaly detection and prediction. The program utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze flight data and identify potential issues before they escalate. The methodology involves generating a mock dataset, feature engineering, training an Isolation Forest model, and evaluating its performance.

## Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The aerospace industry faces challenges in ensuring the safety and reliability of flights. Unexpected failures in critical systems can lead to costly downtime and compromise safety. The predictive maintenance system aims to address these challenges by using AI to detect anomalies in flight data and predict potential issues.

## Methodology

### 2.1 Dataset Generation

A mock dataset was generated to simulate normal and anomalous flight data. Normal data was generated from a standard normal distribution, while anomalous data was generated from two additional distributions with different means.

### 2.2 Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is a crucial step in enhancing the model's ability to detect anomalies. Participants are encouraged to create new features from the existing data, such as aggregating sensor readings over time, calculating moving averages, or incorporating domain-specific knowledge.

### 2.3 Machine Learning Model

An Isolation Forest model was chosen for anomaly detection. The model was trained on a subset of the generated data, and predictions were evaluated on a test set. The contamination parameter was set to 0.05 to account for the expected proportion of anomalies.

## Results

### 3.1 Model Performance

The Isolation Forest model demonstrated promising results in detecting anomalies. The classification report showed good precision, recall, and F1 score for both normal and anomalous classes. The visualization highlighted the model's ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous data points.

## Discussion

The program provides a foundation for predictive maintenance in aerospace systems. In a real-world application, the mock dataset would be replaced with actual flight data. Continuous monitoring and real-time alerting mechanisms would be essential for timely maintenance interventions.

## Limitations and Future Work

### 5.1 Limitations

- **Mock Dataset Realism:** The mock dataset may not fully capture the complexities of real flight data. Real-world anomalies could exhibit more nuanced patterns not present in the simulated dataset.

- **Model Generalization:** The model's performance on the simulated dataset does not guarantee its effectiveness on diverse real-world scenarios. External factors and variations in flight conditions need to be considered.

- **Imbalanced Data:** The imbalance between normal and anomalous instances in the dataset may impact the model's ability to generalize well to real-world scenarios with varying anomaly rates.

- **Assumption of Isolation Forest Suitability:** The choice of the Isolation Forest algorithm assumes that anomalies are the minority in the dataset and can be isolated efficiently. This assumption might not hold in all aerospace scenarios.

### 5.2 Future Work

- **Real Data Integration:** Replace the mock dataset with real flight data to assess the model's performance under actual operating conditions and anomalies.

- **Dynamic Thresholds:** Explore adaptive thresholding techniques to dynamically adjust anomaly detection thresholds based on changing conditions or system behaviors.

- **Multi-sensor Fusion:** Investigate the integration of data from multiple sensors to enhance the model's robustness and provide a more comprehensive view of system health.

- **Online Learning:** Implement online learning techniques to enable the model to adapt to evolving patterns and continuously improve over time.

- **Human-in-the-Loop Integration:** Incorporate human expertise in the anomaly detection process, allowing human operators to validate and refine model predictions.

## Conclusion

The predictive maintenance system demonstrated in this report represents a fundamental step toward improving the safety and reliability of aerospace systems. Acknowledging the limitations and addressing future work will be crucial for the successful deployment and integration of such a system in real-world aerospace applications.
