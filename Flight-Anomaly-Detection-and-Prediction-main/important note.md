# Note: Synthetic Data Disclaimer

The dataset used in this project is synthetic and created for the purpose of demonstration. It does not represent real-world flight data. The synthetic data was generated to simulate normal and anomalous flight conditions and may not accurately reflect the complexities and variations found in actual aerospace systems.

## About the Synthetic Data

- **Normal Data:** Generated from a standard normal distribution to represent typical flight conditions.
- **Anomalous Data:** Simulated using additional distributions with different means to represent potential abnormal situations.

## Purpose of Synthetic Data

The use of synthetic data allows for the development and testing of the predictive maintenance system in a controlled environment. It serves as a starting point for understanding the methodology and implementing the machine learning model.

## Real-World Application

In a real-world application, it is crucial to replace the synthetic dataset with actual flight data to assess the model's performance under authentic operating conditions and anomalies. The transition to real data will provide more accurate insights into the system's behavior and enhance the model's effectiveness in practical aerospace scenarios.

## Acknowledgment

We acknowledge the limitations of using synthetic data and emphasize the importance of validating and refining the predictive maintenance system with real-world datasets for robust and reliable results.
